## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitforAnkit16/React-Component.git
cd React-Component
npm install
Run Dev App
npm run dev
App → http://localhost:5173
Run Storybook
npm run storybook
Storybook → http://localhost:6006
🎯 Components
🔹 InputField
Label, placeholder, helperText, errorMessage
States: disabled, invalid
Variants: filled, outlined, ghost
Sizes: sm, md, lg
🔹 DataTable
Tabular data display
Column sorting
Row selection (checkbox)
Loading + empty state
📘 Documentation
👉 Live Storybook: View on Chromatic
📝 My Approach
I focused on:
Reusability → Both components are typed with TypeScript and accept flexible props.
Scalability → Clear folder structure (components/ + stories/).
Accessibility → ARIA attributes (aria-invalid, aria-disabled) in InputField.
Styling Consistency → Tailwind variants (sizes + states).
Documentation → Each component has dedicated Storybook stories showing different states.
